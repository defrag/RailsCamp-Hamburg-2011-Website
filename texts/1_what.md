Railscamp Hamburg 2011 is a barcamp for Ruby and Ruby on Rails developers. It‘s the second time this annual event will take place in Hamburg, Germany. Last year 175 talents met in town.

It‘s a weekend about technologies, trends, and exchange of experiences in an open and inspiring atmosphere, and so much more. In good barcamp tradition attendance is free for all, food and beverages as well.
